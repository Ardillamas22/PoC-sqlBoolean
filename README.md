# PoC-sqlBoolean
Proof of concept designed to demonstrate how a full database can be extracted or "dumped" using a SQL Boolean Blind Injection. With this method, the attacker leverages the server's boolean responses (true or false) to reconstruct the data stored in the database, character by character.
